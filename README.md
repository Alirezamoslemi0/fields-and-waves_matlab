This project focuses on simulating the concepts of the Fields and Waves course using MATLAB.
In this exercise, the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) is employed to analyze wave propagation in multilayer structures, calculate reflection and transmission coefficients, and design a dielectric mirror.

📘 Sections

Part 1: Calculation of reflection and transmission coefficients at the interface between two media for TM polarization

Part 2: Derivation of transfer matrix relations for multilayer media and comparison with the scattering method

Part 3: Computation of R and T coefficients for different layer thicknesses and incidence angles

Part 4: Design of a high-reflectivity dielectric mirror (|R|² > 0.99)

⚙️ Tools
